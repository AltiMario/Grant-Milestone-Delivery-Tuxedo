## General Notes
Can you please also include a feature to select accounts in case the user connects with multiple accounts to the website?

Also depending on the network chosen the account representation should change. Right now it seems to always display the polkadot representation.

Overall only minor change requests. Thank you!

## vue readme
[readme](https://github.com/philoniare/create-substrate-app/tree/master/packages/vue#compile-and-hot-reload-for-development) says there is the command ``npm run dev`` but it doesn't actually exist.

## angular template
template fails ``npm run test``

also the "connect wallet" button seems to not work correctly. Please give it a check. Seems like once connected accounts in the wallet are changed the website is not updating.

## react template 
In the react-template readme you try to link to the create-substrate-app repo but you link to the actual create-react-app repo.


react app fails ``npm run test``
